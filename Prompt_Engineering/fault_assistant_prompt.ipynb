      "The observed phase voltages (RMS_VA, RMS_VB, RMS_VC) are all at 0.0 volts, indicating that there is no voltage present in any of the three phases. In contrast, the phase currents (RMS_IA, RMS_IB, RMS_IC) show non-zero values, with RMS_IA at 45.0 A, RMS_IB at 46.3 A, and RMS_IC at 44.8 A. This significant discrepancy between the zero voltage and the presence of current suggests a severe fault condition, likely indicating a short circuit or a fault that has effectively removed the voltage from the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2 — Connect the observed imbalance to the given fault class (LLLG).\n",
      "\n",
      "The fault class specified is LLLG, which stands for Line-to-Line-to-Ground. In this type of fault, two phases are shorted together and also connected to the ground. The fact that all phase voltages are zero while the phase currents are present supports the occurrence of a LLLG fault. The imbalance in the phase currents, although relatively small, indicates that the fault is affecting the phases differently, which is typical in a LLLG fault scenario where the ground connection can cause variations in current flow.\n",

      "### Step 3 — Explain the physical mechanism behind this type of fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Line-to-Line-to-Ground (LLLG) fault, two phases of the power system are shorted together, and there is also a connection to the ground. This can occur due to insulation failure, equipment failure, or physical damage to the lines. When this fault occurs, the voltage in the affected phases drops to zero because they are effectively shorted. The ground connection allows current to flow from the remaining healthy phase(s) into the faulted phases and to ground, resulting in the observed non-zero phase currents. The current flow is primarily determined by the impedance of the fault path and the system's configuration, leading to the observed imbalance in the phase currents.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4 — Provide a simple, clean summary suitable for a power systems engineering student.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this analysis, we observed that all phase voltages (VA, VB, VC) are zero, while the phase currents (IA, IB, IC) are non-zero, indicating a severe fault condition. The fault class is identified as Line-to-Line-to-Ground (LLLG), where two phases are shorted together and connected to ground. This type of fault results in zero voltage across the affected phases and allows current to flow from the healthy phase(s) to the faulted phases and ground. The imbalance in the phase currents, although small, is typical for this fault type, reflecting the different current paths due to the fault's nature. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for diagnosing and mitigating faults in power systems.\n"
